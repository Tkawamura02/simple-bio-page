    <p>Please feel welcome to play some <em>lofi beats</em> while reading my bio page. This is one of my favorite youtube channels since there's no specific lyrics to the music except just calm rhythm.

      <h3>My goals</h3>
      <p>I hope to be extremely knowledgeable and wise in the future. I don't necessarily have a particular goal besides wanting to <strong>travel the world eventually</strong>. But a general desire is to be that person who knows the answer to everything.

      <h2>My Favorite Animal</h2>
      <img width=45% src="assets/dogs.jpg" alt="picture of three australian shepherd puppies">
      <p>My favorite animal includes pretty much all animals that walk this Earth, however, since I own six dogs I have to say that I love dogs. My obsession started from my original dog who was given to me as a gift from my parents. He still lives with me and has been my best friend since middle school.
